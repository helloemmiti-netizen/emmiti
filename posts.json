    "content": "We often believe love means having, keeping, securing that okkaru forever.\nBut life, Dostoevsky reminds us in White Nights, tells another story\n Sometimes love is not possession, sometimes it is bearing witness to joy that excludes you.\nLove, in such moments, makes the mundane savage.\nBut asalu daani love anocha?\nLove, at times, hides beneath desperation.\n A desperate man is not only desperate to be desired, he is desperate to survive.\nLike okadu daggara dabbuu untey, hhinks ekkada manchi food tinali?\n Adhe okadu dabbuu lekpotey edo okati tinali.\nLoneliness works the same way.\n The one who can bear it chooses carefully.\n The one who cannot grab whatever will silence the emptiness.\nIt’s exhausting.\n It is not hunger, it is not thirst.\n It is the scream of an empty house, echoing louder than your own breath.\nAnd when you cross paths with someone, you cling to them not always because of love, but because you fear collapse without anyone by your side.\nSo we sugarcoat it, we call loneliness love.\n Because it’s easier to say “nenu premisthunnanu” than to say “nenu ontarini”\nYou don’t want to admit to what desperation tastes like?\n So you start calling it prema.\n Because “love” is prettier.\n Who wants to admit\n I’m lonely, I’m starving, I would burn my skin just to feel someone else’s hand?\nTake Andala Rakshasi.\n Do not tell me it was about love.\nWe are here for Gowtham.\n And Gowtham?\n Gowtham carved worship out of wounds, believing bleeding could become prayer.\nGowtham,\nMridhuna says she’ll wait. \nWho says to herself ? she’ll need time to let go of surya ? But how long before waiting becomes rot?\nshe was able to walk away from Surya, and believe her heart could still beat whole?\nBut how many days, how many nights will you wait before “waiting” becomes its own kind of death?\nThis isn’t about her.\n It’s about you. If you were her, do you think you would ever move?\nDesperation makes us do holy things and sinful things.\n It also makes us move on in order to survive, like in her case.\n It makes us beg shadows to stay a little longer, like in your case.\n It makes us leap off cliffs not from courage, but because falling feels like being held, if only for a second.\nTo every Gowtham out there\nWhat was driving you ? Mridhuna?\n Or the ache inside you, begging for a face to cover it?\nGowtham fantasized about Mridhuna not as his “ame na life lo leka pothey chachipothanu”, but as a way to stitch himself back together.\nThat is the danger of ressentiment \na man, unable to act, hides in imagination and sentiment, convincing himself his suffering is noble.\nEnta rojulu akalini prema peru tho daachukovali?\nGowtham, maybe enduku anta aakali?\n Maybe that’s not where you are supposed to be finding your healing.\nBut this resignation to an ugly sugarcoat called love is sad.\n It is waiting for happiness to come from another’s kindness, instead of willing it into existence yourself.\nTo be free, one must not be content with them.\n Even pain, if willed, can become joy.\n But passivity dressing wounds as worship, disguising loneliness as prema will forever make you small.\nSo stop living in cheekati.\nDo not cling to waiting.\nDo not worship desperation.\nSay yes to life, even when it wounds you.",
